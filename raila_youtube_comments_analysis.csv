I feel deeply saddened by the passing of Raila Amolo Odinga, one of Africa’s greatest political leaders.
He was more than a politician — he was a symbol of courage, democracy, and resilience.
His lifelong struggle for justice, equality, and freedom inspired millions not only in Kenya but across Africa.

I always admired his strength, his voice for the people, and his vision for a better nation.
Kenya and the continent have lost a true statesman — a man who never gave up on the dream of unity and dignity for his people.

May his soul rest in peace. His spirit and legacy will live forever in the hearts of those who believe in democracy and freedom.

So Kenyan people Don’t feel too sad,  Life is like this — people come, and people go.
What matters most is the legacy they leave behind.
Raila Odinga’s name, his courage, and his vision will never die.
His story is already written in the history of Africa, and it will continue to inspire generations.
Let’s honor his life, not only with tears, but with respect for everything he stood for.

Death ends a life, but not a History !!",38,Positive,0.1527972027972028
